# 1. Streamlit RAG Chatbot Application `stAppChatRag.py`

This project demonstrates a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** chatbot using pre-trained models from Hugging Face. The application utilizes the **HuggingFace `sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2`** model for embeddings and the **`google/flan-t5-base`** model for text generation. These models enable the chatbot to generate contextually relevant responses based on both the userâ€™s query and a set of documents stored in **Chroma DB**.

The chatbot is designed to interact with a set of documents, which are initialized at the start of the application. Users can also add or delete documents dynamically to refine the chatbot's knowledge base.
